Vienna Sommer of Logic 2014 - Sign Coordination
===============================================

Before you can start, link `src/vsl.sty` and `src/VSL_logo_big.png` to your
~/texmf/tex/latex/ folder.

Then you can just run `make`.

You probably want to run it with `make -j64` (Needs about 12GB of RAM and much
        CPU Power (the makefiles are not that advanced...))
